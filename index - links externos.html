        <p>PhD in Materials Science with broad laboratory experience in physical metallurgy, materials processing and characterization, equipments design and development. I performed research stages in the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey (CA, USA) and in the technology centre AIMEN (Vigo Spain). During these years I specialized in aluminium alloys, deformation processes and mechanical and microstructure characterization.
I would highlight the skills developed in nanostructuration by severe plastic deformation (FSP, ECAP, HPT, ARB), microstructure characterization by SEM, TEM, EBSD and ACOM-TEM and a broad knowledge in mechanical properties, especially in high temperature deformation mechanisms, creep behaviour and high strain rate superplasticity.
In the future, I would like to increase my knowledge in new materials, novel processing techniques such as Additive Manufacturing and powerful characterization techniques such as FIB and Atom Probe.
I would define me as a materials specialist, passionate about research and solution hunt in an methodical and decisive way, with great skills for group work and good aptitude.
